# Quantitative Analysis of Sentiment towards Fox News on thedonald.win

Well, this is pretty much what the title says. You can find a write-up on this [here](https://www.erichgrunewald.com/did-thedonald-win-turn-agains-fox-news-after-the-election/). The code should be fairly well documented. The repo includes `td_data_processed.csv` which is all you need to reproduce the results. (Scraping the raw data takes a hell of a long time.)

Caveat: I'm an amateur when it comes to statistical modelling, so take all of this w appropriate grains of salt. The model may be buggy. And there are serious limitations in the sentiment analysis.
